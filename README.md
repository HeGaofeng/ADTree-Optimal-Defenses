# Introduction

A tool for finding out the optimal defense nodes under a given cost constraint.   

This tool use Attack Defense Tree to model attack-defense scenarios. In the designed tree model, each defense node has a defense cost attribute and a defense success probability attribute. These two attributes are kept as parameters *MinCost1* and *ProbSucc2* in an XML file. One can generate the tree model from the XML file and find out the optimal defense nodes by this tool conveniently.
